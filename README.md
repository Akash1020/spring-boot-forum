## About the project <a name="about"></a> :link:

The project was developed using _`Spring Boot (2.1.5.RELEASE)`_, so it was adopted an architecture based on microservices using all the power of Spring Cloud and its technologies. When we are working with Spring we have several advantages for gaining technologies and solutions already ready to be implemented, so we made use of some of them.
